## RUNNING THE APPLICATION
*
* Install Node.js library in here:
* https://nodejs.org/ko/download/?fbclid=IwAR038BVoGb1jq_DDC3v5gMNXag7sHZrOifT4UjVQJonKr0LXWh_juf37lj4
*
*
* In terminal, cd into the project directory (Foodle)
*
* Run "sudo npm install", which will install all dependencies related to this app
* (The password will be the password of your machine)
*
* Run "sudo npm install nodemon -g"
*
* Run "nodemon", which will run the application inside localhost:3000
*
*
*   **NOTE: Google Map won't work in localhost. We haven't added api key
*           authentication to localhost for security issues.
*
*
*         The front end was developed with a monitor with resolution 1920x1080 monitor,
*         and thus will not be displayed as intended on devices with smaller resolutions.
*         It should, however, function the same.
*         We have used Google Chrome for the presentation of the project.
